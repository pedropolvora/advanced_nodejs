# Streams 

A stream can be defined as a collection of data that does not necessarily fit in memory nor be fully available at one time.
Streams allow you to use piping in your node code and they might be the best/only solution to handle large blocks of data. Some scripts to make you play a bit with it:

* [A big file generator]('./scripts/stream/bigFileMaker.js')
* [A slow server without streaming]('./scripts/stream/server.js')
* [A fast server with streaming]('./scripts/stream/serverStream.js')
